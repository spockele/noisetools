% function OUT = PsychoacousticAnnoyance_Zwicker1999_from_percentile(N,S,R,FS)
%
%   This function calculates the Zwicker's psychoacoustic annoyance model from scalar inputs
%   corresponding to the percentile values of loudness, sharpness, roughness and fluctuation strength
%
%   The psychoacoustic annoyance model is according to: (page 327) Zwicker, E. and Fastl, H. Second ed,
%   Psychoacoustics, Facts and Models, 2nd ed. M.R. Schroeder. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1999.
%
% - This metric combines 4 psychoacoustic metrics to quantitatively describe annoyance:
%
%    1) Loudness, N (sone)
%
%    2) Sharpness, S (acum)
%
%    3) Roughness, R (asper)
%
%    4) Fluctuation strength, FS (vacil)
