%
%   This function calculates tonality metric by:
%
%   [1] Aures, Wilhelm (1985). "Berechnungsverfahren f√ºr den sensorischen Wohlklang 
%       beliebiger Schallsignale." Acta Acustica united with Acustica 59: p. 130-141.
%
%   The Aures' tonality is based on Terhard's virtual pitch theory, given by:
%
%   [2] Terhardt, E., Stoll, G. and Seewann, M. (1982). Algorithm for 
%       extraction of pitch and pitch salience from complex tonal signals. 
%       J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 71, 679-688. doi:10.1121/1.387544
%
%  Loudness calculation is conducted according to ISO 532:1-2017
%  (type <help Loudness_ISO532_1> for more info)
%
%  This script, Tonality_Aures1985_from_wavfile, calls internally the main
%    algorithm, Tonality_Aures1985. The only difference is that 
%    Tonality_Aures1985_from_wavfile requires a file name as first input
%    argument and the dBFS convention value as the second input argument.
%
%   Reference: a pure tone with 1000 Hz and 60 dBSPL has a tonality of 1 t.u.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% INPUT:
%   wavfilename : char
%   wavfilename specifies the file name of a wav file to be processed
%
%   dBFS : integer
%          Full scale convention. Internally the this algorithm works with 
%          a convention of full scale being equal to 94 dB SPL, or dBFS=94.
%          if the specified dBFS is different from 94 dB SPL, then a gain 
%          factor will be applied
%
%   LoudnessField : integer
%   chose field for loudness calculation; free field = 0; diffuse field = 1;
%   type <help Loudness_ISO532_1> for more info
%
%   time_skip : integer
%   skip start of the signal in <time_skip> seconds for statistic calculations
%
%   show : logical(boolean)
%   optional parameter for figures (results) display
%   'false' (disable, default value) or 'true' (enable).
%
% OUTPUT:
%   OUT : struct containing the following fields
%
%       * InstantaneousTonality: instantaneous tonality (t.u.)  vs time
%       * TonalWeighting: tonal weighting as a function of time
%       * LoudnessWeighting: loudness weighting as a function of time
%       * time : time vector in seconds
%       * Several statistics based on the InstantaneousTonality
%         ** Kmean : mean value of InstantaneousTonality (t.u.)
%         ** Kstd : standard deviation of InstantaneousTonality (t.u.)
%         ** Kmax : maximum of InstantaneousTonality (t.u.)
%         ** Kmin : minimum of InstantaneousTonality (t.u.)
%         ** Kx : percentile InstantaneousTonality exceeded during x percent of the signal (t.u.)

% Stand-alone example:
%   fname = [basepath_SQAT 'sound_files' filesep 'reference_signals' filesep 'RefSignal_Tonality_Aures1985.wav'];
%   dBFS = 94; % default for SQAT
%   Tonality_Aures1985_from_wavfile(fname,dBFS);
