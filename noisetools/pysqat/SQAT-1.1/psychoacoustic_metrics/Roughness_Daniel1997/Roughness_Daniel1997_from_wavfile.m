% function OUT = Roughness_Daniel1997_from_wavfile(wavfilename,dBFS,time_skip,show)
%
%   This function calculates time-varying roughness and time-averaged 
%     specific roughness using the roughness model by Daniel & Weber:
%     Daniel, P., & Weber, R. (1997). Psychoacoustical roughness: implementation
%     of an optimized model. Acustica(83), 113-123.
%
%  This script, Roughness_Daniel1997_from_wavfile, calls internally the main
%    roughness algorithm, Roughness_Daniel1997. The only difference is that 
%    Roughness_Daniel1997_from_wavfile requires a file name as first input
%    argument and the dBFS convention value as the second input argument.
%
%   Reference signal: 60 dB 1 kHz tone 100% modulated at 70 Hz should yield 1 asper.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% INPUT:
%   wavfilename : char
%   wavfilename specifies the file name of a wav file to be processed
%
%   dBFS : integer
%          Full scale convention. Internally the this algorithm works with 
%          a convention of full scale being equal to 94 dB SPL, or dBFS=94.
%          if the specified dBFS is different from 94 dB SPL, then a gain 
%          factor will be applied
%
%   time_skip : integer
%   skip start of the signal in <time_skip> seconds for statistics calculations
%
%   show : logical(boolean)
%   optional parameter for figures (results) display
%   'false' (disable, default value) or 'true' (enable).
%
% OUTPUT:
%   OUT : struct containing the following fields
%
%       * InstantaneousRoughness: instantaneous roughness (asper) as a 
%         function of time
%       * InstantaneousSpecificRoughness: specific roughness(asper/Bark) as
%         a function of time and frequency (Bark scale)
%       * TimeAveragedSpecificRoughness: time-averaged specific roughness 
%         (asper/Bark) as a function of frequency (Bark scale)
%       * barkAxis : vector of Bark band numbers used for the computation
%         of specific roughness computation
%       * time : time vector in seconds
%       * Several statistics based on the InstantaneousRoughness
%         ** Rmean : mean value of instantaneous roughness (asper)
%         ** Rstd : standard deviation of instantaneous roughness (asper)
%         ** Rmax : maximum of instantaneous roughness (asper)
%         ** Rmin : minimum of instantaneous roughness (asper)
%         ** Rx : percentile roughness exceeded during x percent of the signal (asper)

% Stand-alone example:
%   fname = [basepath_SQAT 'sound_files' filesep 'reference_signals' filesep 'RefSignal_Roughness_Daniel1997.wav'];
%   dBFS = 94; % default for SQAT
%   Roughness_Daniel1997_from_wavfile(fname,dBFS);
