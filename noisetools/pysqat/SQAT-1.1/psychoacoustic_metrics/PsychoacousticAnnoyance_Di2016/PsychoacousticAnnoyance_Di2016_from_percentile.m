% function OUT = PsychoacousticAnnoyance_Di2016_from_percentile(N,S,R,FS,K)
%
%   This function calculates the Di's modified psychoacoustic annoyance model from scalar inputs
%   corresponding to the percentile values of loudness, sharpness, roughness, fluctuation strength and tonality
%
%   The modified psychoacoustic annoyance model is according to:
%   [1] Di et al., Improvement of Zwicker’s psychoacoustic annoyance model aiming at tonal noises, Applied Acoustics 105 (2016) 164-170
%
% - This metric combines 5 psychoacoustic metrics to quantitatively describe annoyance:
%
%    1) Loudness, N (sone)
%
%    2) Sharpness, S (acum)
%
%    3) Roughness, R (asper)
%
%    4) Fluctuation strength, FS (vacil)
%
%    5) Tonality, K (t.u.)
%
