% function OUT = PsychoacousticAnnoyance_More2010_from_percentile(N,S,R,FS,K)
%
%   This function calculates the More's modified psychoacoustic annoyance model from scalar inputs
%   corresponding to the percentile values of loudness, sharpness, roughness, fluctuation strength and tonality
%
%   The modified psychoacoustic annoyance model is according to: (page 201)
%   [1] More, Shashikant R. Aircraft noise characteristics and metrics. PhD Thesis, Purdue University, 2010
%
% - This metric combines 5 psychoacoustic metrics to quantitatively describe annoyance:
%
%    1) Loudness, N (sone)
%
%    2) Sharpness, S (acum)
%
%    3) Roughness, R (asper)
%
%    4) Fluctuation strength, FS (vacil)
%
%    5) Tonality, K (t.u.)
